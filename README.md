## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **AutoAI Mode**
   The bot automatically responds to all incoming messages using **LuminAI**, providing context-aware, smart replies. You can activate this feature with the following command:

   ```

   From then on, **LuminAI** will power all automated responses, enabling the bot to intelligently answer queries or interact with users.

### 2. **Engaging Chat Sessions**
   The bot supports **chat session mode**, allowing conversations to feel more interactive and personal. Each user can initiate their own session, focusing on a specific topic, making the chat experience with the bot feel more engaging and fun.

### 3. **Smart Responses**
   Equipped with **LuminAI**, the bot can handle conversations with natural and human-like replies. It continuously learns from interactions, so the more it's used, the smarter and more personalized its responses become.

### 4. **Anti-Ban System**
   There's no need to worry about your WhatsApp account being banned. This bot is designed to comply with WhatsApp's usage policies and operates via the **WhatsApp Web API**, minimizing any risk of getting banned.
